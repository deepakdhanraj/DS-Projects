## Context

Tourism is now recognized as a directly measurable activity, enabling more accurate analysis and more effective policies can be made for tourism. Whereas previously the sector relied mostly on approximations from related areas of measurement (e.g. Balance of Payments statistics), tourism nowadays is a productive activity that can be analyzed using factors like economic indicators, social indicators, environmental & infrastructure indicators, etc. As a Data Scientist in a leading tours and travels company, you have been assigned the task of analyzing several of these factors and group countries based on them to help understand the key locations where the company can invest in tourism services.

## Objective

To explore the data and identify different groups of countries based on important factors to find key locations where investments can be made to promote tourism services.

## Key Questions

1.  Which variables should be used for clustering?
2.  How many different groups/clusters of countries can be found from the data?
3.  How do the different clusters vary?
4.  How to use PCA to retain the components which explain 90% variance?
5.  How to perform clustering using the components obtained from PCA?

## Data Description

This dataset contains key statistical indicators of the countries. It covers sections like general information, economic indicators, social indicators, environmental & infrastructural indicators.
