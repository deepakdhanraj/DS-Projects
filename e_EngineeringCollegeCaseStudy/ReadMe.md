## Objective

To identify different types of engineering colleges in the country to better understand the state of affairs.

## Key Questions

1.  How many different types (clusters/segments) of colleges can be found from the data?
2.  How do these different groups of colleges differ from each other?
3.  Do you get slightly different solutions from two different techniques? How would you explain the difference?

## Data Description

The data contains survey results for 26 engineering colleges. The initial survey data has been summarized into a rating scale of 1-5 for different factors.

#### Factor rating index

-   1 - Very low
-   2 - Low
-   3 - Medium
-   4 - High
-   5 - Very high

#### Data Dictionary

-   SR\_NO: Serial Number
